I developed a timeline chart that displays key solar events such as first light, dawn, sunrise, and solar noon for specific locations. The chart includes a search feature that allows users to input a longitude, latitude, or country name. For example, users can search for Japan, and the timeline will update to show the exact times for first light, sunrise, and other solar events in Japan. This tool provides an accurate and user-friendly way to track solar events in various locations worldwide.
