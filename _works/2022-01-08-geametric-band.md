I developed an entire website for coastal cities policymaking in collaboration with the agency I was working for. The website's highlight is the comprehensive resource hub I created using Strapi. Our client provided data, and I integrated it into Strapi, allowing them to manage and update content easily. I also designed interactive cards and advanced filters for the resource hub. This feature enables users to filter through hundreds of resources, ranging from datasets to case studies, to support informed policymaking in coastal cities. The resource hub significantly enhances the accessibility and usability of critical information for policymakers.
