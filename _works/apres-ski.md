I developed an interactive tool highlighting the world's best resorts for après-ski activities. The tool features a drop-down menu and an interactive table with headers such as rank, overall score, Avg. TripAdvisor Score. Users can click on these headers to sort the table in ascending or descending order based on their preference. The drop-down menu allows users to reorder the resorts by various criteria such as overall score, price of food and drink, ski pass price providing a comprehensive and customizable overview of top après-ski destinations.
