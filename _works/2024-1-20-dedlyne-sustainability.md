I contributed to the Net Zero Tracker tool, which monitors the progress of UK local authorities towards achieving net zero by 2050. I redesigned the map and implemented detailed projections for each authority, incorporating data visualizations for better understanding. Additionally, I made key system design decisions to enhance the tool's functionality.
